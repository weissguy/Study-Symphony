# Study Symphony

## Introduction

Study Symphony is a music recommendation engine, packaged as a Chrome extension for accessible use. It will implement machine learning techniques to "intelligently" suggest soundtracks personally optimized for study and focus. 

## Technical Details

The extension is built with HTML as a backbone, CSS for style, and JS for everything else. JS handles the UI operations, web scraping, and machine learning. Logs of user data are stored in CSV files as long as necessary for regression to be performed.

Users will initially give information on their "normal" music choice for a baseline, and they will input their song reviews and productivity ratings while listening. Regression will be performe don the data to determine ideal song choices for focus and study.

## Progress

As of now, a rudimentary UI is nearing completion (of course, ditching the unpleasant logo and some data cleaning are necessary, still). Web scraping will follow, and finally the meat and bones of the project will come to life--the AI!

Stay tuned for further growth!
